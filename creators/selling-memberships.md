# Selling Memberships

There are multiple ways to sell memberships, and some of the integrations built by the community already include that step. However, in some context, you may want to have a single URL to share with your community so they can purchase your membership!

### Using a purchase URL

Our dashboard offers a "purchase" URL that can easily be shared. 

![The Purchase URL is visible on the dashboard](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)

You can set a custom redirect URL to which the URL is redirected when they have unlocked the membership.

There are more advanced customization options, but they will require some more advanced techniques, which you can find in our developer section.

### Re\(selling\) memberships

Unlock memberships are Non-Fungible Tokens \(using the ERC721 standard\), which means the owner of a membership NFP can list it on marketplaces such as OpenSea and others!
