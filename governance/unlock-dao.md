# Unlock DAO

Work in progress. Please follow progress on our [community site](https://unlock.community/t/introducing-the-dao/).

In its early days, the purpose of the DAO is the following:

* Manage some UDT funds
* Manage other tokens owned by the protocol \(liquidity tokens\)
* Own the Unlock Contract
* Own the Unlock Proxy Admin

We expect the DAO to have other capabilities, eventually.
