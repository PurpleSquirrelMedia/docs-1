  Querying smart contracts directly from your application is always an option,
  but, when your application needs to retrieve large collections or multiple

# Subgraph

Unlock leverages the [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) to simplify the process of making meaningful applications leveraging the Unlock Smart Contracts and associated data.

The Graph Protocol provides an accessible GraphQL service providing useful aggregate Unlock data from the Ethereum blockchain. The links below provide a rudimentary tool to build and test your queries.
